The host files for an unknown iteration of version 40.xx. It is dated April 9th, 2004 and according to /u/thenaterator, this version is "when the morgue was new. I think it was when the character customization thing was new, too. Maybe it's just plain version 40. But, I don't know. It's pre-changes verb, and it doesn't mention the version number in the startup." It is one of the host files released by /u/thenaterator, and is the earliest version of SS13 that I have been able to find thus far, and possibly the earliest still in existence.
