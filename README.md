# Pre Open-SS13 Host Files and Source
SS13 host files and source from before Open SS13. These are the oldest available versions of SS13 that I could find, and it took me a hell of a lot of digging, so I'm posting them here in the hope that anyone with an interest in the history of SS13 can check this stuff out without having to dig through forum archives or the wayback machine. Credit goes to the original SS13 devs, and Hobnob for doing the work on this, decompiling the source and making it available, even after all these years. Think of this repo as an educational resource for anyone interested in the early history of SS13.

There's 13 things here, each is explained in their respective readmes. Check this reddit thread out for more details: http://www.reddit.com/r/SS13/comments/2vrcap/a_look_into_the_early_history_of_ss13/ 

Credit for versions 40.something to 40.91.08 goes to /u/thenaterator from /r/ss13 who made 7 hostfiles from 2004-2005 available, allowing an even better glimpse into the early history of SS13.

Credit for the "Late 2003" version of SS13 goes to /u/mirablue from /r/ss13 who made this hostfile available in September 2016. This is the earliest known version of SS13 still in existence, and the only known version from 2003. As such, it is the best possible way to get a look at the early days of SS13.

Have anything else from this period? Set up a pull request and I'd be glad to merge it.

Enjoy!
