# Pre Open-SS13 Host Files and Source
SS13 host files and source from before Open SS13. These are the oldest available versions of SS13 that I could find, and it took me a hell of a lot of digging, so I'm posting them here in the hope that anyone with an interest in the history of SS13 can check this stuff out without having to dig through forum archives or the wayback machine. Credit goes to the original SS13 devs, and Hobnob for doing the work on this, decompiling the source and making it available, even after all these years. Think of this repo as an educational resource for anyone interested in the early history of SS13.

There's 5 things here, each is explained in their respective readmes. Check this reddit thread out for more details: http://www.reddit.com/r/SS13/comments/2vrcap/a_look_into_the_early_history_of_ss13/ 
Have anything else from this period? Set up a pull request and I'd be glad to merge it.

Enjoy!
