<font size="-2">A guide to Role Playing on Space Station 13.<br>
By Miranda "Blu" L.</font><p>

So, you've happened upon this lovely game, Space Station 13. You may feel some strange, new, exciting changes and urges.<br>
Many of which involve a toolbox.<br>
But, "no!" cry your peers. "You GRIEFER! Host, ban him!" They all say.<br>
Well, ha ha, that's because you just haven't learned of the magic of roleplaying.<br> 
"Roleplaying?" You might say, confused. "What on earth is that?!" <br>
Well, little Jimmy, that's what got all of your peers to hate you! Ha ha! But, enough of that.<p>

Roleplaying is similar to the games of house, doctor, or neighborhood battle to the death that you played as a kid.<br>
What? Didn't you play any of those? <Br>
If not, you're a blight to humanity, I say!<br>
But enough about that. <br>
The details of roleplaying's "rules" vary from person to person and medium to medium-- and in Space Station 13, there are few set rules except the rules of common sense, decency, consent, and "what the host says goes".<br>
When playing Space Station 13, you may find most people tend to obey the last one most. Which is a good thing-- the host is the one who runs the server, and allows you to play the game by causing trouble to their computer.<p>

Roleplaying, to generalize, is putting yourself in your character's place. If you truly have no idea what a character is like, just try pretending it was you in the character's situation: a direct self-insert. Modify a few things about you to help you fit in the SS13 setting, and there you have it.<br>
Once you've become more experienced with roleplay, you may want to try making characters that deviate further and further from yourself. Another gender, another personality type... there are endless possibilities.<br>
A good method of making a character from scratch that I've found involves starting with a few words that describe your character ("selfish", "two-faced", "charming"), and coming up with little quirks for them, as well as fleshing out their personality. Such as how they got to where they are, and other things.<br>
A good guide to creating a well-rounded character can be found at the following URL:<br>

If you have found joy and glee in what people call "griefing" (i.e: bombing, wearing the SWAT and/or Robot suits, attacking), it's often best to discuss it thoroughly with the host or active server administrators before you go on your rampages.<br>
Page them using BYOND's pager (or IM them, if you know their instant messanger screen name), and ask if you can obtain permission to do whatever normally-irritating thing you want to do! That way, everyone knows that it's alright, and no one has to worry about it.<br>
However, if the host/administrator says no, just don't do it.<br>
It's like drugs, or something! <p>

Now, little Jimmy, don't you feel better now that you know how to roleplay on Space Station 13?<br>
(Just smile and nod, Jimmy.<br>
Smile and nod.)
